The first program takes an input from commmand line and determines if it is a valid password.  A password is valid if it contains:  a capital letter, a lowercase letter, an integer, and a symbol (!@#&).  If the password is not valid, the program will suggest a change to the password and the user can check it's validity by inputing the suggested changes.
